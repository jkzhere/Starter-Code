      <h3>Standard X-Ray Grids.</h3>
      <p>Superior construction of lead strips and aluminum inter-spacers, with smooth, enameled aluminum covers, sealed against dirt and moisture.<br>
Grids may also be ordered with carbon fiber composite covers.<br>
For added protection of your valuable grids and convenience of handling and operation, these grids can be installed in various forms of grid encasement's: Flat Lexan® encasement's, grid caps, Lexan® encasement's with cassette channels and grid cassettes.<br>
Selection of High Precision Materials / Durability & Inspection<br>
To obtain the most effective X-Ray transmission and absorption, as well as grid density uniformity and precise geometric arrangement for strip focusing, these grid are manufactured utilizing the finest precision materials, such as aluminum strips with a purity of 99.99% and a thickness tolerance of ±0.02mm, and lead strips with a purity of 99.85% and a thickness tolerance of ±0.001mm.<br>
Each grid strip is laminated and baked after the gluing procedure. This ensures absolute rigity between the strips, as well as heat and moisture resistance and completely prevents warping and cracking over the course of time. Each grid is subjected to radiographic testing prior to shipment, and only those grids which have passed the test for perfect strip alignment are delivered to the customer. The test film supplied with all the grids is your assurance of quality.</p>
<h3>Grid Encasement can be ordered along with your grid and are found futher down on this page!</h3>
<p>Parallel grids are used for operational research and traumatology since exact centering is impossible in this case. The scattered radiation absorbing strips are vertical and parallel to the grid surface. The strips, generally, run parallel to the long dimension of the grid. In order to get a vivid radiograph, focal distance of parallel grids must be 150cm-infinity since the scattered radiation absorbing strips are not exactly parallel to the diverging radiation.</p>

      <h3>Collimators.</h3>
      <p>Ralco's Multi-layer, square field, manual collimator.<br>
With a lightweight and compact design this collimator is intended for installation on both mobile and stationary X-ray equipment.<br>
This device has been designed and manufactured for skeletal investigations and ER applications.<br>
The X-ray field is defined by six pairs of shutters, four of which are lead-lined. The six pairs of shutters move perpendicularly within the X-ray field. Two pairs of brass shutters are located near the focus, two are located near the entrance window and two are located near the exit window of the X-ray beam from the collimator. The latter shutters serve to accurately define the X-ray field edges. Shutter movements are manual, controlled by two knobs on the collimator front panel.<br></p>
<h4>Features:<br>
Projection Lamp: White LED<br>
Single Layer Square Adjustable Field: 0x0cm to 48x48cm at 100cm SID<br>
Mounting Plane at 80 mm (3.14") from the focus.<br>
Continuous Film Coverage from Min: 00 x 00 cm to Max: 48 x 48 cm at 100 cm (40") SID.<br>
Minimum Inherent Filtration: 2mm/Al equivalent<br>
Accessory Guides are used for accessories and additonal filtration.<br>
Retractable Tape mounted on the side of unit for measuring SID distance.<br>
High brightness White LED simulating the X-ray field controlled by an electronic timer.<br>
Minimum Inherent Filtration 2mm/Al equivalent.<br>
Auto-centering top plate (RO 318) with high resistant resin mounting flange allowing +/-<br>
45° rotation of the collimator, the flange is included.<br>
Dimensions: 270.5x183x168 mm<br>
6 Pairs of Shutters</h4>
