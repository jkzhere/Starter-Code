      <h3>Hand Sanitizer.</h3>
      <p>Our sanitizer is alcohol based made to the formula recommended by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the FDA.<br>

It contains no gels or scenting agents to inhibit its effectiveness. The sanitizer has a distinct alcohol odor which disappears in 10 - 15 seconds as the product evaporates, leaving behind no lingering smell. It also contains a small amount of glycerin which acts as a moisturizer to keep from drying the skin.<br>

Using this hand sanitizer promotes hand hygiene throughout your facility wherever soap and water are not available.<br>

The sanitizer clings to the hand and is easy to spread, ensuring full coverage and a smooth end user experience.<br>

Bottles are 64 ounces, (1/2 gallon).<br>
Case (4 bottles) ships at 17 pounds, dimensions of 13" x 13" x 13"<br></p>
